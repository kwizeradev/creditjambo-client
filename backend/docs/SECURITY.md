# Security Implementation

## Password Hashing

### Algorithm: SHA-512 with PBKDF2

It uses SHA-512 with PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) for password hashing.

**Configuration:**

- **Hash Function**: SHA-512
- **Iterations**: 100,000
- **Salt Length**: 16 bytes (128 bits)
- **Key Length**: 64 bytes (512 bits)

### Why PBKDF2 with 100,000 Iterations?

1. **Computational Cost**: Each password hash takes ~10-50ms, making brute-force attacks extremely expensive
2. **Industry Standard**: Recommended by NIST, OWASP, and security experts
3. **Adjustable**: Can increase iterations as hardware improves
4. **Time Tested**: PBKDF2 has been thoroughly analyzed and proven secure

### Implementation Details

#### Hashing Process

```typescript
hashPassword(password: string, salt?: string)
```

1. Generate random 16-byte salt (if not provided)
2. Apply PBKDF2 with SHA-512, 100,000 iterations
3. Return both salt and hash (both stored in database)

#### Verification Process

```typescript
verifyPassword(password: string, salt: string, passwordHash: string)
```

1. Retrieve stored salt and hash from database
2. Hash the provided password with the stored salt
3. Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
4. Return true/false

### Security Features

✅ **Random Salt**: Each password gets unique 16-byte salt  
✅ **High Iteration Count**: 100,000 iterations prevent brute-force  
✅ **Constant-Time Comparison**: Prevents timing attacks  
✅ **No Plaintext Storage**: Passwords never stored in plain text  
✅ **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses Node.js crypto module

### Attack Resistance

| Attack Type       | Protection                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Rainbow Tables    | Unique salts make precomputed tables useless      |
| Brute Force       | 100,000 iterations make each attempt expensive    |
| Dictionary Attack | Computational cost makes these impractical        |
| Timing Attack     | Constant-time comparison prevents timing analysis |

### Password Requirements

When implementing validation, enforce:

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 uppercase letter (optional but recommended)
- At least 1 special character (optional but recommended)

### Token Security

For refresh tokens and other sensitive tokens:

1. **Generation**: Use `crypto.randomBytes()` for cryptographically secure random tokens
2. **Storage**: Hash tokens before storing in database
3. **Comparison**: Use constant-time comparison when verifying
